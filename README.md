#  Fake-to-Factual Text Generation using AI

This project uses a pre-trained text-to-text generation model to convert misleading or fake text into factual, reliable statements. It was developed and tested using Google Colab and is integrated with GitHub for collaboration and version control.

##  Project Overview

The goal is to explore how AI can help transform false or misleading information into factual, reliable sentences using advanced NLP models. This project can support content moderation, educational tools, or misinformation detection systems.

---

##  Features

-  Accepts input sentences and corrects them to factual statements
-  Runs efficiently in Google Colab
-  Uses tokenizer and pre-trained NLP model
-  Supports text-to-text generation pipeline
-  Easily extendable for other NLP use cases
